# Boggle

By: Kevin, Rohan, Mandana, Nicholas

Boggle Game made in Java with a Graphical User Inerface. Run boggleWithGUI.java code in a Java IDE.

Description:
The game is played using a plastic grid of lettered dice, in which each player searches for words that can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjacent cubes, where "adjacent" cubes are those horizontally, vertically, and diagonally neighboring. The minimum length of the word can be 2 to 4, and the time and score limit are based on user's preference.
We also created a two player mode where two players take turns to search for words in the same grid. Whoever reach the score limit first wins.
